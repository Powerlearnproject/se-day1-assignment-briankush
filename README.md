#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and necessary methods so as    to develop and maintain high quality software systems that are efficient, reliable and scalable.

  Some of its importances in the technology industry include:
  1. It enhances the quality of softwares in that through testing and code review, possible errors are identified 
   and dealt with
  2. It reduces costs since well crafted softwares reduce downtime ensuring that there is continious flow of 
   buisness operations.
  3. There is improved efficiency and production since development time can be greatly reduced through collaboration using tools such as version control systems ie Git.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1. The birth of software engineering: This took place in the early 1950s to 1960s, during the NATO Software         Engineering Conference, where the need for a systematic approach to software development became evident.
    2. Waterfall model: Which was introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce ni 1970, which helped ensure each phase of   
        projects were thoroughly completed before moving on to the next.However this approach did not accomodate 
       changes well leading to the rise of more flexible methods.
    3. Rise of Agile model: Which arose due to the constrains of the waterfall method, in 2001




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Software development life cycle consists of the following stages:
  1. Requirements Gathering- entails documenting all the system requirements and users needs
  2. Design- This stage involves crafting of high level and detailed designs of the software
  3. Implementation- In this stage the actuall coding of the software according to its design takes place.
  4. Deployment- The software is made available to the users for testing
  5. Maintenance- This stage involves handling the necessary updates and enhancements after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  The waterfall model is a sequential approach of software development in which each phase builds upon the       
  previous one. It has clearly defined phases and changes are difficult to implement after the initial phase.
  
  On the other hand agile model is an itterative and incrimental approach which mainly focuses on      
  flexibility,collaboration and respond to change.It consists of cycles of itterations with continious feedback and changes can be accomodated throughout the development process.

  The water fall model is more likely to be used when a projects requirement are clear and unlikely to change   
  while agile model is most likely to be used when a lot of changes are expected and flexibility is needed
  


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  a)Software Developer:
      > Get a clear scope and understanding of the projects requirements
      > Implement the project by writing clear and efficient code
      > Deploy the software for testing, review and maintenance
  b) Quality Assuarance enigineer:
      > Responsible for coming up with relevant test cases based on the project requirements.
      > Work hand in hand with the developers to be able to identify bugs and improve general software quality
      > Carry out perfomance testing to ensure that the software can handle the necessary load without issues
  c) Project Manager:
      > Maintain all the records, updates and reports on the project
      > Acts as the bridge between the development team and client
      > Allocate the necessary tasks to developers and designers
      
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    
  IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, testing, editing and debugging code within one interface. Some of    the common IDEs include: VS code, Intellij etc.
  Versio Control Systems enable the tracking changes made to code overtime and also multiple developers to   
  collaborate on the same project.They also store code remotely preventing codeloss. Examples include Git and   
  Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Some of the common challenges faced are:
    Debbuging and fixing bugs that arise from systems, some of which moght be difficult to handle
    Keeping up with the current available technologies since languages and tools keep evolving
    Having to deal with tight deadlines and heavy workloads.
  Strategies to solve these problems include:
    Keep themselves on toes through continious learning and following up on the latest trends in htechnoloogy
    Modularization of projects to make them much easier to handle.
    Utilization of  advanced IDEs with built in debbuggers.
    

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing mainly focuses on the testing of the individual components of a system in isolation. It helps in 
    identification of bugs in the early stages of development making it easier to fix.
  Intergration testing focuses on testing how different components of a system work together so as to ensure they 
    interract as expected when combined.
  System testing involve testing the complete software as a whole when intergrated, which ensures the entire system
    behaves according to the desired requirements.
  Acceptance testing which is the final stage of testing is often perfomed by the users to ensure that the 
    software meets the buisness needs and is ready for deployment. It confirms whether the software meets user     
   satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the process of designing prompts to effectively interract with models of AI. Its importance is that it enhances efficiency and improve on response quality.It also helps customization for diffrent uses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  initial prompt: "Tell me about Manchester city"
  Improved prompt:"In not less than 200 words give a detailed report on Manchester City football club, clearly   
  indicating all their players and all the titles they have won since 2000
  The improved one is much more effective than the initial one since it clearly indicates all the information that is needed.
